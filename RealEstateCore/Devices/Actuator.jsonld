Examples include setting dampers/valves in heating/cooling systems at certain configurations, opening or closing a smart lock, turning on or off an electric radiator, etc. REC does not provide semantics for every type of actuator you might find in a building; rather we here provide classes and properties that allows users to define their own actuator models, based on the systems they have, adhering to REC."
